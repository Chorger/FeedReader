      <title>The Year That Putin Won</title>
      <link>https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/the-year-that-putin-won-56699</link>
      <description>The year 2016 looked decidedly more promising for Russia and its rulers than 2014. Domestically, no serious challenge arose to the current social and political order. Internationally, Russia is no longer the kind of pariah it was in 2014 and 2015.</description>

      <description>This is Putinâ€™s personal revenge on Obama for having labeled Russia a â€œdecliningâ€ and â€œregionalâ€ power. With the Russia-Turkey-Iran axis, it is the U.S. that is the declining power on the Middle East.</description>

      <link>https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/moscow-2016-the-prince-and-the-penguin-56688</link>
      <description>In Moscow, 2016 will go down as a complicated year. Perhaps it will be viewed as the first step toward a shiny, orderly dystopia. Or maybe it will go down in history as a year when more order (and pink penguins) were enforced on the unruly inhabitants.</description>

      <title>Russia Enters a Time of Transition, by Stealth</title>
      <link>https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russia-enters-a-time-of-transition-by-stealth-56629</link>
      <description>2016 was the year in which Russia rediscovered politics. The media began feeding on leaks from senior officials, poorly disguised as â€œinvestigative journalism.â€ Russians can now read about the new villas, yachts, airplanes, and offshore companies that belong to the Kremlin retinue. All this dirty laundry being aired in public suggests there is now a behind-the-scenes power struggle at the top. You could call it â€œfilthy glasnost.â€ The Kremlin felt the effect of this trend in Septemberâ€™s parliamentary elections. Paradoxically, even though United Russia, the pro-Kremlin ruling party, did better than ever, the results showed that Russiaâ€™s rulers can no longer take public support for granted.</description>
